This folder contains:

	[1] dgraph.py
		Define a module that creates objects of graph with methods 
		such as finding the shortest path between two vertices, 
		plotting the graph, and identifying cycles.
		
	[2] test.py
		Demonstrate how to import the module to show the graphical 
		illustration of a graph.
		
	[3] Basics of Directed Graph.ipynb
		A Ipython notebook that contains dgraph.py. Users can run
		computation interactively.

Run the Python script under Windows with command prompt:

	If we want to see if the test case can be successfully 
	executed not by importing it but running it directly, 
	type "python dgraph.py" without the double quotation 
	marks and hit Enter.*

	*On Windows, the PATH environmental variable should include the 
	directory of python.exe.
	
	In test.py, the module dgraph has been imported right in the 
	begining of the script. We can type "python test.py" to run 
	the example and find the graphical illustration of the graph
	defined in the example popped up.
