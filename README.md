This folder contains:

	[1] dgraph.py
		Define a module that creates objects of graph with methods 
		such as finding the shortest path between two vertices, 
		plotting the graph, and identifying cycles.
		
	[2] test.py
		Demonstrate how to import the module to show the graphical 
		illustration of a graph.
		
	[3] Basics of Directed Graph.ipynb
		A Ipython notebook that contains dgraph.py. Users can run
		computation interactively.

Run the Python script under Windows with command prompt:

	If we want to see if a test case can be successfully 
	executed not by importing it but running it directly, 
	type "python dgraph.py" without the double quotation 
	marks and hit Enter. We should expect to see a pop-up
	window showing a graphical illustration as well as
	relevant description and computation output of the 
	graph displayed in the command line window.*

	*Under Windows, the PATH environmental variable should include
	the directory of python.exe.
	
	In test.py, the module dgraph has been imported right in the 
	begining of the script. We can type "python test.py" to run 
	the example and find the graphical illustration of the graph
	defined in the example popped up.
